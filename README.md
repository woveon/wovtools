WovTools manages the configuration and staging for a Kubernetes development/DevOps team. WovTools covers writing code, environment setup, database changes and Kubernetes cluster deployment. Development occurs across local to individual Kubernetes namespaces to dev and prod Kubernetes namespaces.

## Guiding Philosophies: 

- Kubernetes is effecient, logical and robust... after it is setup.
- Existing tools work well and can be leveraged as development moves to DevOps on a cluster.
- Developers work individually and collaboratively.

## About

WovTools was create by Woveon to support our own systems. We eat our own dog food.
