WovTools manages the configuration and staging for a Kubernetes development/DevOps team. WovTools covers writing code, environment setup, database changes and Kubernetes cluster deployment. Development occurs locally, then to individual developer Kubernetes namespaces and then to organization dev and prod Kubernetes namespaces.

### Guiding Philosophies: 

- Kubernetes is effecient, logical and robust... after it is setup.
- Existing tools work well and can be leveraged as development moves to DevOps on a cluster.
- Developers work individually and collaboratively.

### About

WovTools was create by Woveon to support our own systems. We eat our own dog food.
